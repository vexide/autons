//! # autons - Autonomous Selection & Routing Library for `vexide`
//! 
//! `autons` is a library that provides standard interfaces for autonomous route selectors
//! in programs using the `vexide` robotics runtime. `autons` also provides some basic reference
//! implementations of such selectors (see: [`SimpleSelect`]) that can be used for selecting
//! different autonomous routes.
//! 
//! [`SimpleSelect`]: crate::simple::SimpleSelect
//! 
//! An "autonomous route" is an asynchronous function takes a robot struct and runs during the
//! autonomous period of a robotics match. When programming robots, we often have many different
//! routes that we want to choose between depending on conditions of the match. Rather than
//! uploading these routes as individual programs to different slots, `autons` provides a way for
//! us to choose between these routes in a single program at runtime.
//! 
//! ```
//! async fn route_1(robot: &mut MyRobot) {
//!     // do stuff...
//! }
//! 
//! async fn route_2(robot: &mut MyRobot) {
//!     // do other stuff...
//! }
//! 
//! async fn skills(robot: &mut MyRobot) {
//!     // run skills...
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! # Usage
//! 
//! In `vexide`, you normally have only one `autonomous` function provided to you through the `Compete`
//! trait:
//! 
//! ```
//! impl Compete for MyRobot {
//!     async fn autonomous(&mut self) {
//!         // route goes here...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! With `autons`, you can instead use the [`SelectedCompete`] trait, which is a modified version of
//! vexide's `Compete` trait that allows for multiple autonomous routes chosen through a struct
//! implementing the [`Selector`] trait. Here is a basic example using the [`SimpleSelect`] selector
//! with two routes on our robot:
//! 
//! [`SelectedCompete`]: crate::compete::SelectedCompete
//! 
//! ```
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//! 
//! extern crate alloc;
//! 
//! use autons::{
//!     prelude::*,
//!     simple::{route, SimpleSelect},
//! };
//! use vexide::prelude::*;
//! 
//! struct Robot {}
//! 
//! impl Robot {
//!     async fn route_1(&mut self) {}
//!     async fn route_2(&mut self) {}
//! }
//! 
//! impl SelectedCompete for Robot {
//!     async fn driver(&mut self) {
//!         // ...
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! #[vexide::main]
//! async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
//!     let robot = Robot {};
//! 
//!     robot
//!         .compete(SimpleSelect::new(
//!             peripherals.display,
//!             [
//!                 route!("Route 1", Robot::route_1),
//!                 route!("Route 2", Robot::route_2),
//!             ],
//!         ))
//!         .await;
//! }
//! ```
